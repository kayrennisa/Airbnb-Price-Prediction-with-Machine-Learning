# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

This repository is a place to share my code and notebooks for this data science project using Python.

### The objectives of this project are to:
1. Discover the set of important features for Airbnb price prediction.
    - Using Feature Selection - Backward Elimination Method
2. Leverage on customer reviews (unstructured data) through sentiment analysis for price prediction.
    - Applying Sentiment Analysis to the dataset using VADER 
3. Evaluate the performance of the predictive model selected. (Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Bagging Regression and Random Forest Regression.)
    - Conducted 4 experiments to evaluate the performance of each predictive models.

### Experiments:
1. Listing Data without Feature Selection or Sentiment Analysis
2. Listing Data with Feature Selection
3. Listing Data with Sentiment Analysis
4. Listing Data with Feature Selection and Sentiment Analysis

### Evaluation Measures

In this experiment we utilise 5 evaluation measures to compare the performance of predictive models.
- R2
- Mean Absoulte Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Cross Validation Score
