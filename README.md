# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

This repository is a place to share my code and notebooks for this data science project using Python.

###The objectives of this project are to:
1. Discover the set of important features for Airbnb price prediction.
    • Using Feature Selection - Backward Elimination Method
2. Leverage on customer reviews (unstructured data) through sentiment analysis for price prediction.
    • Applying Sentiment Analysis to the dataset using VADER 
3. Evaluate the performance of the predictive model selected. (Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Bagging Regression and Random Forest Regression.)
    • Conducted 4 experiments to evaluate the performance of each predictive models.

###Experiments:
• #1 - Listing data without feature selection or sentiment analysis.
• #2 - Listing data with feature selection.
• #3 - Listing data with sentiment analysis.
• #4 - Listing data with feature selection and sentiment analysis.

###Evaluation Measures

In this experiment we utilise 5 evaluation measures to compare the
performance of predictive models.
• R2
• Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
• Mean Squared Error (MSE)
• Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
• Cross Validation Score (CVS)
